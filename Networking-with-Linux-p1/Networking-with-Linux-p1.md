# Introduction to Networking with LINUX PART-1
## 1 INTRODUCTION
When it comes to networking, there is probably nothing that cannot
be done with Linux.
Some one said once : Programming is learnt better with examples
rather than with theories and books. Here are commands explained
with example. But donâ€™t rely only on this article. This is only
the insight into what can be done. See manual pages for more
information.
## 2 ping
**send ICMP ECHO REQUEST to network hosts**
ping is the most basic command. And it is by default installed in all linux sys-
tems. This can be used to check if your internet connection is working properly.

It verifies the connection by sending packets of data. Use ctrl-C to stop it
otherwise it will keep sending data. In the end it provides a brief summary of
what has been done. It sends 1 packet each second by default. here you can see
172.217.166.238 is the exact IP address of server. It also provides the length of
time taken to return data.

Flag *-c* **n** specifies exactly n number of packets to send.
Afterwards the command auto stops.

Flag *-i* **n** specifies exactly n seconds wait before sending next packet.
And Flag *-n* says to print only numeric outputs.
As manual says: only superuser can set interval less than 0.2 .
There even more options, like you can set a deadline time for ping to stop
with *-w* **deadline**.
Default packet size is 55 but you can change it with *-s* **packetsize**.
#### NOTE :-
> Some network devices are configured to ignore these packets for security reasons. Even some firewalls are configured to block ICMP traffic.
> example site : w3schools.com .
> "ping w3schools.com" will fail to recieve any packets .
