# Introduction to Networking with LINUX PART-1
## 1 INTRODUCTION
When it comes to networking, there is probably nothing that cannot
be done with Linux.

Some one said once : Programming is learnt better with examples
rather than with theories and books. Here are commands explained
with example. But donâ€™t rely only on this article. This is only
the insight into what can be done. See manual pages for more
information.
## 2 ping
**send ICMP ECHO REQUEST to network hosts**

ping is the most basic command. And it is by default installed in all linux sys-
tems. This can be used to check if your internet connection is working properly.

**Figure 2.1**

It verifies the connection by sending packets of data. Use ctrl-C to stop it
otherwise it will keep sending data. In the end it provides a brief summary of
what has been done. It sends 1 packet each second by default. here you can see
172.217.166.238 is the exact IP address of server. It also provides the length of
time taken to return data.

**Figure 2.2**

Flag *-c* **n** specifies exactly n number of packets to send.
Afterwards the command auto stops.

**Figure 2.3**

Flag *-i* **n** specifies exactly n seconds wait before sending next packet.
And Flag *-n* says to print only numeric outputs.
As manual says: only superuser can set interval less than 0.2 .

There even more options, like you can set a deadline time for ping to stop
with *-w* **deadline**.
Default packet size is 55 but you can change it with *-s* **packetsize**.
#### NOTE :-
> Some network devices are configured to ignore these packets for security reasons.
  Even some firewalls are configured to block ICMP traffic.

> example site : w3schools.com .

> "ping w3schools.com" will fail to recieve any packets .

## ifconfig
**configure a network interface**

Ifconfig  is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces.
It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary.
After that, it is usually only needed when debugging or 
when system  tuning  is needed.

![Figure 3.1](image/ifconfig.png)

**Figure 3.1**

If no arguments are given,
ifconfig displays the status of the currently active interfaces. 
If a single interface argument is given,
it displays the status of the given interface only.

Using grep to see a specific result.
Here I show data uses by the Ethernet Interface.
RX is recieved amount of data and TX is transfered data since last login.

## traceroute
**print the route packets trace to network host**

Trace every server that request jumps from or to in order to get to the host server.

![Figure 4.1](image/traceroute-thisp.png)

**Figure 4.1**
    
We see asterisks in the line when router do not provide identifying information.
In cases where routing information is blocked, we can sometimes overcome this by adding
either the -T or -I option to the traceroute command.
